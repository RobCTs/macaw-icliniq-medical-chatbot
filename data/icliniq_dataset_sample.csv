Entry 2:
Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request. 

 ### Instruction: If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description. 

 ### Input: i am currently on the yaz contraceptive pill i skipped my sugar pills for around four months and had a breakthrough period this month i had my period last week but i still have some residual brown discharge for about a week now additionally i had sex a few days ago and bled during it nothing hurts or is sore i just want to know how long i am going to have the brown discharge and if i should be worried or if i should do anything about it 

 ### Response: hello the brown discharge should be temporary i would recommend you have a period for the next couple of months and not skip the placebo pills temporarily to get back on track if you have not missed any pills pregnancy is very unlikely but i would recommend a pregnancy test for added reassurance if you have not had a recent test for stds like gonorrhea or chlamydia i would also get tested for those as these infections may have no symptoms and can cause spotting or bleeding after intercourse if the problem continues and no other cause can be found you can consider changing to a different pill take care
